# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

Python Basics:

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Some key features include:

    Easy to Learn and Use: Python's syntax is straightforward and emphasizes readability.
    Versatility: It supports various programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional).
    Large Standard Library: Python comes with a vast collection of modules and libraries for different tasks.

Examples of Use Cases:

    Web Development: Django and Flask frameworks for building web applications.
    Data Science: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
    Automation: Writing scripts for automation tasks due to its simplicity and cross-platform compatibility.

Installing Python:

To install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), follow these steps:

    Download Python: Visit the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) and download the installer for your operating system.

    Run the Installer:
        Windows: Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the installation prompts. Ensure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
        macOS: Run the downloaded .pkg file and follow the prompts.
        Linux: Python is often pre-installed on Linux. Use your package manager (e.g., apt-get for Ubuntu) to install Python.

    Verify Installation: Open a command prompt (or terminal) and type python --version or python3 --version to verify Python is installed correctly.

    Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
        Install virtualenv if not already installed: pip install virtualenv.
        Create a virtual environment: virtualenv myenv.
        Activate the virtual environment:
            Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
            macOS/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate

Python Syntax and Semantics:

Here's a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

python

# hello_world.py
print("Hello, World!")

Explanation:

    print() is a built-in Python function used to output text to the console.
    "Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes.

Data Types and Variables:

Basic data types in Python include:

    int: Integer numbers (e.g., 5, -10).
    float: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, 2.718).
    str: Strings of characters (e.g., "hello", 'world').
    bool: Boolean values (True or False).
    list: Ordered collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
    dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 30}).

Example script demonstrating variables:

python

# variables.py
# Creating variables
x = 5       # int
y = 3.14    # float
name = "Alice"  # str
is_student = True  # bool
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # list
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}  # dict

# Accessing variables
print(x)
print(name)
print(numbers[0])
print(person["age"])

Control Structures:

Conditional Statements:

python

# conditional.py
# If-else statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

Loops:

python

# loops.py
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

Functions in Python:

Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code used to perform a specific task. They are defined using the def keyword.

python

# functions.py
# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print("Result:", result)

Lists and Dictionaries:

Lists are ordered collections, while dictionaries are unordered collections with key-value pairs.

python

# lists_and_dicts.py
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary of person's information
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Accessing elements
print(numbers[0])        # Output: 1
print(person["name"])    # Output: Alice

# Adding new elements
numbers.append(6)
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"

Exception Handling:

Exception handling in Python allows you to handle errors gracefully using try, except, and optionally finally.

python

# exception_handling.py
# Example with division by zero error
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")

Modules and Packages:

Modules are Python files containing functions and variables, while packages are directories of modules. You can import and use modules in your scripts.

python

# math_module_example.py
# Using math module
import math

# Calculating square root
num = 25
sqrt = math.sqrt(num)
print("Square root of", num, "is", sqrt)

File I/O:

File I/O in Python involves reading from and writing to files.

python

# read_file.py
# Reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# write_file.py
# Writing to a file
data = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
with open('fruits.txt', 'w') as file:
    for fruit in data:
        file.write(fruit + '\n')

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
